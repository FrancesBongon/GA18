/* 
Right: In this case, I thought of two ways to solve this. 
One which involves using intval() to force integer.

$id = intval($_GET['id']);

// Or we could apply prepared statement which is more secure.

With these, we can prevent the entire rows from being deleted 
if the user were to input 0 or 1=1 because the query is now safe 
and the id will only be accepted.
