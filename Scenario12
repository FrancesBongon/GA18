// Wrong: The id is an integer yet it was still used as a value
which is not really efficient, and sometimes wrong use of index.
// $sql = "SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = '$id'";

// Correct: Remove the quotes or cast it on integer.
$id = (int) $_GET['id'];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = $id";

/*
I modified the query to remove the quotes from the id, 
which is an integer value. I also use (int) to cast it to an integer, 
ensuring that the id is a number and making the query more efficient. 
If there are quotes, it sometimes becomes a string comparison, 
which can result in the wrong index being retrieved.
