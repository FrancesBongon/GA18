<?php

// Wrong: Wrong use of $_POST when the form method is GET.
// $email = $_POST['email'];

// Correct: Use $_GET instead of $_POST because the form method is GET
$email = $_GET['email'];

/*
If $_POST were used in a GET method instead, 
it will only result to undefined index error
because there is no POST data being delivered.
